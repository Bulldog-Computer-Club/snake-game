# Web-based Snake Game

Minimal (but functional!) snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Graphics taken from [straker's Snake implementation](https://gist.github.com/straker/ff00b4b49669ad3dec890306d348adc4).

# Things to try

- Reupload this repository under your own account
- Host the website using GitHub Pages
- Fix bugs/missing features indicated with FIXME comments in `script.js`
- Improve graphics (e.g., make snake rounded)
- Implement an AI player that makes moves automatically
